## New on v 6.25


- **New parameter in ATLEAST tag in reports allows for the number of rows of a dataset to be multiple of a number.** Now when using [ATLEAST](http://www.tmssoftware.biz/flexcel/doc/net/guides/reports-designer-guide.html#ensuring-a-table-has-at-least-n-records) you can specify that the number of rows must be a multiple of some number. That is, that the dataset must have for example 20, 40, 60... rows but not 30 or 45. Take a look at the new [Fixed Footer demo](http://www.tmssoftware.biz/flexcel/doc/net/samples/csharp/reports/fixed-footer/index.html)

- **Improved handling of invalid "," in numeric formats.** A comma in a numeric format means "thousands separator" if it goes after the 3rd digit, like in "#,000". But when a comma is at the end of the format, it means scale: A format like "0," means divide the number by 1000. FlexCel already handled those cases correctly, but there are some "impossible" cases like "0,0" which are not actually valid but might be saved to xlsx files. FlexCel was interpreting that the "," in some of those cases meant scale, while for the same cases Excel was interpreting "thousands separator". Now we should behave like Excel even in the invalid cases.

- **FlexCel could fail when rendering cells with more than 32000 characters.** A cell in Excel is limited to 32767 characters, but a string in GDI+ is limited to 32000 characters. So if a cell had between 32000 and 32767 characters, FlexCel would raise an Exception when rendering the file becaus eGDI+ would fail to render the string. Now it should render correctly.
