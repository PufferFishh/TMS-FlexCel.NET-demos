## New on v 6.17.3.0 - October 2017


- **New TFlxNumberFormat.PercentCount method.** The new method [TFlxNumberFormat.PercentCount](http://www.tmssoftware.biz/flexcel/doc/net/api/FlexCel.Core/TFlxNumberFormat/PercentCount.html) allows you to know how many non escaped % symbols are in a format string.

- **Better display of negative zero numbers.** Now a negative number that displays as zero like "-0.001" formatted with a "0.0" format string will display as "0.0" and not "-0.0"

- **iOS demos updated to require iOS 8 or later so they can be compiled with XCode 9.** iOS demos targeted iOS 6, which isn't supported in XCode 9. Now we target iOS 8.
