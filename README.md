## New on v 7.1.1 - January 2020


- **New __ALIAS postfix in named ranges allows multiple ranges to the same database.** Now if you need to define 2 names to the same dataset in the same sheet, you can name them like "__dataset1__ALIAS_SomeUniqueId" and "__dataset1__ALIAS_OtherUniqueId". Take a look at [Alias bands in the report designer's guide](http://www.tmssoftware.biz/flexcel/doc/net/guides/reports-designer-guide.html#alias-bands)

- **Bug Fix.** Effects for an image in the background of an image could be incorrectly saved. In some cases, this could cause Excel to crash.

- **Bug Fix.** When using a not standard row height for the whole sheet, FlexCel would create new rows to have automatic height, instead of having the standard row height for the sheet. This could confuse Excel.

- **Bug Fix.** FlexCel will now check that font sizes saved are between 1 and 409 points. Before it would let you save any font size, and invalid font sizes would crash Excel when opening the file.

- **Bug Fix.** The report designer failed to start.

- **Bug Fix.** In some corner cases charts saved by FlexCel inside xlsx files would fail to load.
